I developed a dynamic weather application that leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information based on user input. The app offers a seamless, interactive experience, allowing users to input any city and instantly receive up-to-date weather details, making it a convenient tool for staying informed about weather conditions around the world.







How It Works:
  1) User Input: The application allows users to enter the name of any city they wish to check the weather for.
  2) API Integration: Once the user inputs a city, the app fetches the corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates. These coordinates are passed to the OpenWeatherMap API, which returns accurate, real-time weather data for that specific location.
  3) Weather Information: The API response includes detailed weather data such as the current temperature, basic weather description (e.g., clear skies, cloudy, rainy), and an associated weather icon.
  4) Responsive Design: The app uses Bootstrap CSS to ensure that the interface is visually appealing, organized, and responsive across different screen sizes and devices. The weather information is neatly presented within a user-friendly layout that       enhances the overall experience.






     
Technologies Used:
  1) OpenWeatherMap API: The core of the applicationâ€™s functionality, providing access to current weather data based on geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
  2) Flask: The web framework used to render HTML templates and manage backend logic, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and the weather API.
  3) Bootstrap: Bootstrap's CSS functionalities are utilized to structure and style the HTML elements, creating a clean, responsive user interface.
